## Plant Disease detection app.

now we have come to the ai and ml powered part of the project.
this plant disease detection app uses an ensemble of 3 CNN models.
it has a whopping accuracy of arounf 98.5%.
It is capable of detecting 8 species and upto 20 diseases!.
![ML - Plant Disease Detection App](ReadMe_Images/8.1_plant_disease_detection.jpg)

You can upload leaf images and the model will detect specie as well as the disease.
![ML - Plant Disease Detection App](ReadMe_Images/8.2.jpg)
even though the accuracy is 98.5%, we cannot be arrogant and say that it will never give a wrong result. therefore. we have a button for repredict on wrong prediction. it will then give the next most likely disease. but from next time onwards, for the same leaf, it will give correct result in one go. this is because it stores results.

We also have a class probabilities bar chart which shows the probability of the leaf lying in a particular class

## Farm-ChatBot

we also have a farm chatbot that can help resolve queries such as disease remedies, precautions, best fertilisers, seasonal info etc. it does not do all this using an api. it is custom traned on farm related data given by us, if however it is unable t find answer from us, it then uses 3rd part api calls to get the answer. this intelligent fallback support helps always give an answer.

## Blogging

![Bloggs](ReadMe_Images/9.1_blogs.jpg)
we all have stories to tell and experiences to share.
our blogging platform helps farmers share their experience with the community creating a more familiarenvironment and aware environment.
The blogging platform is also beautifull crafter=d and detailed.

### üí° Why this Project?

Agriculture is evolving, and so should the tools that support it. **Farmers' Companion** is built to **digitize essential services**, foster **community collaboration**, and bring **AI-driven insights** directly to the fields ‚Äî all in one platform.

# üåæ Hey there, fellow human! Welcome to Krishi Mitra! 

*Translation: "Farmers' Friend" - because who doesn't need a good friend, especially one that knows tech?*

So you stumbled upon **Krishi Mitra**, huh? Well, buckle up because this isn't your average "let's digitize farming" project. This is what happens when someone (me) had way too much coffee, a passion for agriculture, and thought "Hey, what if we could make farming as smart as smartphones?"

## ü§î What the heck is this thing?

You know that feeling when you're trying to help farmers but all the existing solutions are either boring, confusing, or just plain useless? Yeah, me too. So I built this beast of a platform that's basically like having a tech-savvy farming buddy who never sleeps.

**Krishi Mitra** is a full-stack web application that does ALL the things:
- üõí **Direct selling** - Skip the middleman drama
- üî¨ **AI-powered disease detection** - Because plants get sick too
- üí¨ **Smart chatbot** - Your 24/7 farming consultant
- üìù **Community blogging** - Share your "this crop failed spectacularly" stories
- üó∫Ô∏è **Market directory** - Find markets without getting lost

## üöÄ The Grand Tour (Screenshots Included Because I'm Proud)

### Landing Page - First Impressions Matter!
Look, I spent *way* too much time on this landing page. It's beautiful, functional, and doesn't make your eyes bleed. Here's what you're getting yourself into:

![Landing Page](ReadMe_Images/1.1launch.jpg)
*This is where the magic begins*

As you scroll down, you'll see more eye candy:

![Even More](ReadMe_Images/1.4.jpg)
![Keep Going](ReadMe_Images/1.5.jpg)
![Almost There](ReadMe_Images/1.6.jpg)

### Market Directory - Google Maps Wishes It Was This Cool
We've got an interactive map that actually works (shocking, I know) and a list of markets that won't leave you guessing.

![Market Directory](ReadMe_Images/2.1MarketDirectory.jpg)
*That's our fancy interactive map up top*

![Market Listings](ReadMe_Images/2.2marketDirectory.jpg)
*All the markets, organized and ready to explore*

### Explore Markets - The Detailed Stuff
When you click on a market, you don't just get "Market exists. Location: somewhere." Nope! You get the full deal:
- Precise location with a map that actually loads
- What they sell and when
- Hours, parking, food options
- Real reviews from real people

![Market Details](ReadMe_Images/3_market_show.jpg)
*Everything you need to know about this market*

![Reviews Section](ReadMe_Images/4_reviews_and_rating.jpg)
*Real people, real opinions, real helpful*

### Market Creation - For the Brave Souls
Want to add your own market? I built a form that's actually pleasant to use (revolutionary concept, I know).

![Register Market](ReadMe_Images/5.1_register_market.jpg)
*It's detailed but not painful*

### User Stuff - Register & Login
Because even farmers need secure accounts:

![User Register](ReadMe_Images/6_user_register.jpg)
![User Login](ReadMe_Images/7_login.jpg)
*Clean, simple, secure - the holy trinity*

## üß† The AI Magic - Plant Disease Detection

Okay, this is where I get really excited. Remember how I mentioned AI-powered disease detection? Well, I wasn't kidding.

**The Stats That Matter:**
- 98.5% accuracy (yeah, you read that right)
- 8 different plant species
- Up to 20 diseases detected
- Uses an ensemble of 3 CNN models because one just wasn't enough

![Disease Detection App](ReadMe_Images/8.1_plant_disease_detection.jpg)
*Upload a leaf photo, get instant diagnosis*

![Results Page](ReadMe_Images/8.2.jpg)
*Complete with probability charts because data is beautiful*

**The Cool Part:** If the AI gets it wrong (hey, nobody's perfect), there's a "repredict" button that gives you the next most likely result. Plus, it learns from mistakes, so next time it'll get it right on the first try.

## ü§ñ Farm ChatBot - Your 24/7 Farming Buddy

This isn't just another chatbot that gives you generic responses. This one's actually trained on real farming data and knows its stuff about:
- Disease remedies
- Fertilizer recommendations
- Seasonal advice
- General farming wisdom

**Smart Fallback:** If it can't answer from its training data, it seamlessly uses the OpenAI API as backup. So you always get an answer, never a "I don't know" response.

## üìù Blogging Platform - Share Your Stories

![Blogging Platform](ReadMe_Images/9.1_blogs.jpg)
*Because everyone has farming stories to tell*

![Blog Features](ReadMe_Images/9.2.jpg)
![More Blog Features](ReadMe_Images/9.3.jpg)
![Even More Blog Features](ReadMe_Images/9.4.jpg)
*A full-featured blogging platform that doesn't suck*

Whether you want to share your success stories, epic failures, or just daily farm life, this platform has you covered.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Technical Stuff (For the Nerds)

**Architecture:** Built with the tried-and-true MVC pattern because I believe in doing things right.

**Security:** 
- Secure authentication with Passport.js
- Password hashing (because storing passwords in plain text is so 2005)
- Session management that actually works

**Database:** MongoDB for flexible data storage

**Backend:** Node.js with Express.js for the API

**AI/ML:** 
- Ensemble of DenseNet, EfficientNet, and MobileNet models
- Deployed with Streamlit
- Custom training on agricultural datasets

**APIs:** OpenAI integration for chatbot fallback support

## üå± Why Did I Build This?

Simple. Agriculture is the backbone of civilization, but most farming tools are stuck in the stone age. I wanted to create something that:
- Actually helps farmers
- Doesn't require a PhD in computer science to use
- Brings AI benefits to agriculture
- Builds community among farmers
- Looks good while doing it

**Krishi Mitra** isn't just another app - it's a complete ecosystem for modern farming.
